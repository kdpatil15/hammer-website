<h1>Hammer is a new company</h1>

<p style="background-color: rgb(255, 239, 204);">
<em>Are you sick of search engines returning "news", ads, and SEO spam when you wanted information?<br/>
<br/>
If this is you, you need a Hammer. The world needs a Hammer.</em>
</p>

<h3>Our mission:</h3>
"To organize the world's information and make it accessible to anyone who pays Hammer $30/month"

<h3>Our motto:</h3>
"Don't be evil. And if we ever remove this motto, it's because we are evil now."

<h3>Our slogan:</h3>
"Better search, better results. Hammer"

<h4>Proposed funding model:</h4>

How many people would sign up for this service a year before it exists?<br/>
If I believed it would happen, I know I would.<br/>
Could we get 1000? If so, this might be doable to bootstrap.<br/>
You would get a "True Believer" badge for life in your account.

<h4>Seeking applications for the following role(s):</h4>

Founder (cause I never want to start another company)<br/>
* Must agree to an "Unbreakable Vow" of never becoming evil.<br/>
* Must have mad infrastructure skills cause otherwise how could you know who to hire?
<br/><br/>
Got several job applications already, but none for the one position Hammer is hiring for.<br/>
If you are looking for a SW eng job at a similar vibe of company, consider <a href="https://comma.ai/jobs">applying to comma</a>.

<h4>Why now?</h4>

Modern language model tech has made really good search possible.<br/>
Who will build something that is good and not just one big ad?
